<p>Why the ePortfolio?</p>
<p>This website is an example of an electronic Portfolio (ePortfolio) that's been miniaturized to focus on a single soil series. The original idea here was to offer students in ENSC245 a unique alternative to the semester's cumulative assignment, FSR3. In years past, FSR3 has been a more traditional report/oral presentation style assignment in the past, and we are hoping to change that.
Essays and reports are great and all, but as a way of assessing what a student knows, they are as ancient as learning technology gets. Actually, essays aren't that great at all. For centuries, teachers have assigned essays for students, so while these kinds of assignments might be regarded as tried-and-true in the historical canon of education, the structure and process of essay writing really only caters to a small section of the learning styles(http://academic.regis.edu/ed205/kolb.pdf) that are out there. </p>

<p>It is 2016 after all, so let's get with the program.</p>

<p>In the last couple of decades, educators have become more aware of the need to assess and encourage different learning styles. High impact practices(HIPs) are considered one of the keys to improving learning outcomes, increasing engagement, and closing the achievement gap in higher education.</p>

<p>Electronic Portfolios (ePortfolios) are online records of learning. They are considered an effective way to assess students' experiences with HIPs, and, in the case of reflective ePortfolios, they are regarded as a HIP in their own <a href="https://www.aacu.org/peerreview/2015/fall/hubert"> right </a>.</p>

<p>Digital storytelling is all about creating a narrative out of information, and then compiling it in a modern format. This could include music videos, animations, podcasts, or infographics â€“ really anything that goes beyond a wall of text. As an educational tool, digital storytelling offers students the chance to be creative and to use different expressive mediums, but it can be difficult to assess more subjective measures of success.</p>

<p>The utility of ePortfolios for exercising employable skills (like web design and digital communication fluency), and encouraging critical thinking have been <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.473.7438&rep=rep1&type=pdf">demonstrated</a>, but the use of ePortfolios to have only rarely been used to expand on digital storytelling. We hope that having students share their digital stories in an ePortfolio will result in a better educational experience for the student and a more holistic and robust means for the instructor to assess those educational experiences.</p>
