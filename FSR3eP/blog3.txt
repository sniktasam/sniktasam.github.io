<p>Self evaluation.</p>

<p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1990-97359-000">Reflective practice</a> is an important part of the experiential education process. Seems to me like a good topic for a blog post.</p>

<p>Reflecting back on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxihEYDBQgY">soils song</a>, I'm most immediately aware of a lack of informative content or narrative structure. As song writers, we were most concerned with finding lyrics that fit with the rhythm of the song, and as a result, our final product is easily digestible but relatively superficial.</p>

<p>In blog post 2 I went on about the difference between educational value and entertainment value, and if we were to do this song over a bit more, I'd like to think of ways to bump up the amount of information contained in the song, while maintaining or increasing the entertainment value. But how could this happen?</p>

<p>Looking at successful examples (like <a href="https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM">this one</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej0b7GHGYjs">this one</a>) of digital storytelling, the first thing that jumps out at me is production value. The first of these videos is more formal in style than the second, but they are both undeniably <i>slick</i>. As amateur content producers, even our best efforts at doing a music video wouldn't git anywhere near these examples, but our performance could easily have been better rehearsed. </p>
