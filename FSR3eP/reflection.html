          <p>The process of writing a song as a group was definitely more fun than plugging through a final essay, and thanks to the musical talent of Alex, the process was fairly smooth. For all the fun that we had, the crux was trying to cram actual information into something that didn't sound like total garbage. Looking back on it almost three years later, it's clear that we weren't able to put that much info about our actual project in. </p>
          <p>That's kind of the hard part about anything communcation related though, isn't it? How do you take the stuff that you want someone to take away, and present it in a way that grabs their attention? In a way, that's the question we're trying to answer with this ePortfolio research project.</p>
