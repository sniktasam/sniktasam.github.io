<p>Towards better tech in the classroom.</p>

<p>The crux of digital storytelling, I think, is how to toe that line between being palatable and being informative. For the most part, I think these two are inversely correlated, that is, the more information that is packed into a minimally viable product, the less appealing it is from a consumer standpoint. While you could argue that creating compelling digital media is more art than science, we researchers still try to quantify what exactly it is that makes something <i>work</>, and the question I really want to get at, is how can you optimize this relationship?</p>

<p>Educators have a small advantage in the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Economy-Understanding-Currency-Business/dp/1578518717">attention economy</a>, in that they have a relatively captive audience (though some argue the attention economy is <a href"https://www.themediabriefing.com/article/peak-content-the-collapse-of-the-attention-economy">collapsing</a>, it's still a viable model for explaining the ongoing negotiation of student interest and engagement with digital products). But, educators often miss the mark with <a href="https://edtechnow.net/2012/12/05/tel/">technology</a>. If we really want to optimize technology in the classroom, which implies that we have to get smarter about not just <i>what</i> we teach, but <i>how</i> we teach it.</p>

<p>Going back to the relationship between information and appeal, we should be able to measure each of these attributes. In a digital learning environment, content knowledge is a good metric for what information was obtained by the pupils, and it's a relatively easy thing to measure. Appeal is a more subjective quality, but <a href="http://upworthy.github.io/2014/06/implementing-attention-minutes-part-1/">web analytics</a>can give a good approximation on of engagement. Preliminary data from Obery, et. al., has shown what I suggested earlier, that engagement and content knowledge are inversely correlated, but the problem is, <b> this completely goes against everything conventional wisdom of teaching!</b> What this suggests is that by creating more exciting, engaging content, you are reducing student learning outcomes.</p>

<p>Clearly there is more complexity to this relationship. Compounding variables, which I envision as having a phase shift effect on the knowledge/engagement relationship, such as production value, transparency, and recursive fatigue, are numerous and their impacts difficult to tease out. Nevertheless, I don't think this is a call to abandon all hope of creating better teaching content. Rather, I return to the question of optimization. With limited resources, how can we as educators maximize our ROI on technology implementation? </p>

<p>Answering this question is the whole idea behind this shot at using digital storytelling and ePortfolios. Is this practice a panacea? Likely not, but not more tools we have, and the better we understand them, the better job we can do at teaching. We want to take the same approach that we take in the lab to the classroom, something like data-driven teaching.</p>
