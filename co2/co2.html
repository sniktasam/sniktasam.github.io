        <h2>A basic CO<sub>2</sub> stream</h2>
        <p>Live streaming data is something that sounds great to most scientists. For us environmental scientists, the prospect of live data eliminating the tedious “sneaker-netting” of data (that is manually plugging-in to offload records), is a sort of nirvana – a technological paradise where data magically appears when and where you want it. Of course, <a href=”https://www.campbellsci.com/cr200x-series”>these systems</a>  have existed for years, but they are clunky, and more importantly costly! As technological know-how increases, the day grows ever closer when a button-click (or screen-tap) will offer immediate information about our surroundings. This is the central idea behind the “Internet of Things (IOT)” movement, and its potential for environmental science and <a href=”grows ever closer “>education</a>has not gone un-noticed.</p>

        <p>Our lab has a slick piece of equipment that measures CO2 gas. Its called a Li-Cor 820, and its great for high-accuracy measurements, but it doesn't connect to the internet very easily. I was tasked with the simple premise of making a public keeling curve for our lab, basically to put CO2 data from the Li-Cor onto the internet.</p>
        <a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sniktasam/sniktasam.github.io/master/imgs/outline.png"><img src="/imgs/outline.png" alt="CO2" style="width:100%"></a>

        <p>After much research I settled on using <a href=”https://plot.ly/”>Plot.ly</a>, mostly because I'm shallow and they make pretty graphs, but also because of a nifty streaming python-api. I'm programming mostly in python these days, so not having to mess with node servers or mysql/php was an upshot, and they have great documentation.</p>
        <p>I came up with the python script below: </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/sniktasam/2ef7816a61132a9b9df8.js"></script>
        <p>which takes the xml stream that comes into the computer (via serial.readline()), and adds those values, along with a time-stamp, to a stream of data that goes directly to plotly's servers, and makes a nice looking graph! Check out the code for yourself, and let me know if you have questions.</p>
